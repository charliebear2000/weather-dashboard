# Weather Dashboard
***

## General Info
This is an assignment for my coding bootcamp. The assignment is to create a website to search for weather conditions in a city. I had to use the Open Weather API to retrieve the search information.  The specifications that it required are:
* When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
* The results show the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
* The uv index is color coded based on favorable, moderate, or severe conditions.
* A 5-day forecast for the city is displayed with the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
* When the user clicks on a past search in the search history, then that city's weather conditions are presented.
